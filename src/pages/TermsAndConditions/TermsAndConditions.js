            accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made

            We may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in
            our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we
            post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services

            provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply

            that You accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check
            this page from time to time so You are aware of any changes, as they
            are binding on You.

          <p className="font-roboto-mono fs-18px  lh-1_5">
            We reserve the right to introduce, withdraw or amend websites, or
            any content, material, product offering or other Services, in our
            sole discretion without notice. We make no guarantee that the
            Services will be available at any time, and we will not be liable if
            for any reason all or any part of the Services is unavailable at any
            time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to
            some parts of the Services, or the entire Services, to users,
            including registered users. You are responsible for making all
            arrangements necessary for You to have access to the Services. To
            access the Services or some of Cool Cats’ Purchaser-only resources,
            You may be asked to provide certain registration details or other
            information. It is a condition of Your use of the Services that all
            the information You provide to access the Services is correct,
            current, and complete. You agree that all information You provide to
            register for these Services or otherwise, including, but not limited
            to, through the use of any Purchaser-only features, is governed by
            our{" "}

            information consistent with our Privacy Policy. If You choose, or
            are provided with, a user name, password, or any other piece of
            information as part of our security procedures, You must treat such
            information as confidential, and You must not disclose it to any
            other person or entity. You also acknowledge that Your account is
            personal to You and agree not to provide any other person with
            access to the Services or portions of them using Your user name,
            password, or other security information — not even to another person
            associated with Your business. You agree to notify us immediately of
            any unauthorized access to or use of Your user name or password or
            any other breach of security. If You are using a public or shared
            computer, You also agree to ensure that You exit from Your account
            at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when
            accessing Your account from a public or shared computer so that
            others are not able to view or record Your password or other
            personal information. We have the right to disable any user name,
            password, or other identifier, whether chosen by You or provided by
            us, at any time if, in our opinion, You have violated any provision
            of these Terms of Service.
